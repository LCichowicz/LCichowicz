 Weekend Trip Advisor Agent – Capstone Project\n","##  by Łukasz Cichowicz\n","### Based on Kaggle 5 Day Intensive GenAI Course with Google.\n","\n","**Weekend Trip Advisor Agent** is an interactive, generative AI-powered assistant designed to help parents find family-friendly events happening near their location.  \n","It uses natural language understanding and vector-based semantic search to recommend local weekend activities tailored to user preferences such as travel distance, trip date, interests, and their children's age group.\n","\n","As a father of two sons, I often find myself wondering how to spend our weekends in a way that's not only exciting and educational, but also a refreshing break from screens — something that helps us create lasting memories together.\n","\n","That’s how the idea for this project was born: an AI-driven tool that helps parents (like myself!) discover engaging weekend activities for their families.  \n","By combining generative AI with real-world context, it brings people closer — not just online, but in real life.\n","\n","This project was developed as part of the **[Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1]**, showcasing multiple core GenAI capabilities through a structured and interactive
