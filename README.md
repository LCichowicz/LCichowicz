# Hi, I'm Łukasz 👋

Junior Data Scientist working with AI systems, transitioning from logistics into data and backend development.

I focus on building practical solutions using LLMs, data processing and APIs.  
I prefer shipping working systems and learning through real-world problems.

## 📌 Selected Work

### 🤖 AI Agent Development (AI_Devs 3 & 4)

Hands-on work with agent-like systems:
- building tool-based workflows
- retrieval + vector search (RAG)
- iterative prompting with validation, caching and logging
- early work on reusable agent loop architecture

Status:
- AI_Devs 3 completed (solutions currently being refactored)
- AI_Devs 4 in progress — focus on modular agent design

### 📊 Weather Notifications for Windsurfing — Visualization

- processed weather API data
- built visualizations to support decision logic

Status: completed module (small but real contribution)

## 🧠 Practical Experience

Working as a Junior Data Scientist on commercial systems:

- building and integrating APIs (email delivery, webhooks)
- implementing user flows (e.g. invitation system with validation and email handling)
- designing dynamic prompt configuration using YAML-based inputs
- working with asynchronous processes and handling failure cases
- debugging production issues (race conditions, inconsistent state, edge cases)

Working knowledge of:
- MongoDB (queries, debugging data, understanding document structure)
- basic application security practices (e.g. API access control, environment-based config)

Exposure to:
- event-driven design (message-based communication)
- schema thinking, validation, and data contracts

> Code not public due to commercial constraints

## 🚀 Current Focus

- building reusable AI agents (not one-off scripts)
- understanding system design (events, contracts, reliability)
- improving Python data stack (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
