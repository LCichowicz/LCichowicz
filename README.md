Hi, I'm Łukasz 👋

Junior Data Science / AI practitioner transitioning from logistics into Machine Learning. I build practical prototypes, work with LLMs, and turn messy data into usable outputs. No hype — just learning, iterating, and shipping.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python

Data/ML: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers

LLMs: OpenAI API, prompt engineering, tool/function calling, RAG with embeddings (ChromaDB)

Platforms/Tools: Git & GitHub, Kaggle, Azure AI Foundry (learning), Streamlit (planned app deployment)

Other: JSON/YAML processing, API integrations, data parsing & cleaning

📌 Selected Projects

🛰 AI_Devs 3 — AI Agent Challenges

Hands‑on course with agentic tasks: LLM tools, vector search, multimodal cues, RAG.

Implemented agents for retrieval, extraction and decision logic

Built RAG pipelines with embeddings + vector DB

Iterative prompting with validation, caching, loggingStatus: Course completed (threshold met). Currently refactoring solutions and preparing public repos.

Repos will be cleaned up and pushed publicly. Some tasks stayed private due to course rules; I’ll publish sanitized code and write-ups.

🚚 Transport Delay Prediction — Proof of Concept

Predict delays using route, weather, and terrain signals.

Phase 1: heuristic scoring

Phase 2: ML on GPS + historical delays (planned)Status: Prototype work & design notes; next step: dataset assembly and baseline.

🏖 Weekend Trip Advisor — Prototype → App (planned)

Kaggle prototype that recommends weekend trips (events within ~100 km, cost to travel, preference fit).

LLM for input parsing + short summaries

Google data sources for events/places (to be integrated in app)Status: Currently a prototype; target is a working Streamlit app (public repo) with minimal, focused UX.

📊 Weather Notifications for Windsurfing — Viz Work

Built weather visualizations to flag windsurfing conditions.

Parsed weather API data

Designed plots to support alert logicStatus: Visualization module complete; candidate for a small standalone repo.

🎓 Learning & Certifications

Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science (Coursera Specialization)

AI_Devs 3 — advanced agentic workflows (threshold met)

Preparing for DP‑100 (Azure Data Scientist Associate)

🚀 Current Focus

Solidifying Python data stack (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Cleaner RAG + evaluation loops for LLM outputs

Turning prototypes into small, reliable apps (Streamlit, later Azure AI Foundry)

More statistics/probability/linear algebra — because fundamentals matter
